* Change font name from "Benton" to "Benton-Sans" to align with CDN and fix
[this issue](https://github.com/bu-ist/responsive-foundation/issues/50) [See related pull request](https://github.com/bu-ist/responsive-foundation/pull/89)
* Simplify the breakpoint mixin to accept any variable, and open up the target
breakpoint for <=IE8 to modification in custom themes. Use any value you like,
it'll just work now! `max-width` support is deprecated as of 2.0 since the
intention of this mixin is to print styles safely in older versions of IE -
`max-width` styles are unlikely to be the last styles to apply.
[See related pull request](https://github.com/bu-ist/responsive-foundation/pull/89)
* A new approach for centering, `center-children`, using flexbox. Old
approaches will still be available for the forseeable future - just use
`vertical-center-ie8` or `vertical-center-ie9` as appropriate for your needs
[See related pull request](https://github.com/bu-ist/responsive-foundation/pull/89)
* Documentation for mixins and change `%visuallyhidden` to `%visually-hidden`
to comply with coding standards for naming [See related pull request](https://github.com/bu-ist/responsive-foundation/pull/89)

[See related pull request](https://github.com/bu-ist/responsive-foundation/pull/89)

and removing width variables which don't get a lot of use [See related pull request](https://github.com/bu-ist/responsive-foundation/pull/88)
* Adds a new z-index scale to help manage layering of multiple interactive elements [See related pull request](https://github.com/bu-ist/responsive-foundation/pull/87)
